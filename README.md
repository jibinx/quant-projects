# ðŸ“ˆ Quantitative Finance Projects

This repository documents my independent journey into quantitative finance and machine learning, focusing on:

- Stochastic modeling & SDE simulations  
- Volatility forecasting (ARCH/GARCH models)  
- ML-based price direction prediction  
- Numerical methods for financial PDEs

 **Goal:** Build a strong foundation in quantitative finance research and applied machine learning.

###  Background & Skills

- Completed IIT Kanpurâ€™s intensive 1-month AI/ML course, building a strong foundation in machine learning concepts and Python programming.  
- Currently applying this knowledge to quantitative finance projects involving stochastic modeling, volatility forecasting, and financial machine learning.

---

###  Programming Languages & Skills

- Python (primary for quant modeling & ML)  
- C and C++ (good understanding of core concepts like classes, inheritance, and OOP; currently refreshing skills)  
- Familiar with libraries: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, ARCH
